# Sketching a WebGPU for shaders like ReduceBuffer

### HybridShader API
- [ ] What does the 'lifecycle' api look like in TypeScript?
- [ ] How is conditional compilation handled? e.g. for subgroups
- [ ] How are generics handled?
- [ ] How is reconfiguration handled?
- [ ] What does the API look like in Rust?
- [ ] What changes for TypeGPU?

### Plugin user functions
- [ ] How do javascript applications 'plug in' functions, e.g. to map before reduce?
- [ ] How can we optionally support types for 
- [ ] How does this integrate with wesl reflection
- [ ] How does this integrate with typegpu
- [ ] How does this integrate with 'vanilla' wgsl strings

### WESL code
- [ ] How do you write workgroupReduce to share with other shader authors?
- [ ] How do you write ReduceBuffer? generics? conditions? binop?
